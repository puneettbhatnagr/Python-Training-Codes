    "# Dictionaries\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "We've been learning about *sequences* in Python but now we're going to switch gears and learn about *mappings* in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're familiar with other languages you can think of these Dictionaries as hash tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mappings are a collection of objects that are stored by a *key*, unlike a sequence that stored objects by their relative position. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important distinction, since mappings won't retain order since they have objects defined by a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Dictionaries in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Python dictionary consists of a key and then an associated value. That value can be almost any Python object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating a dictionary is as simple as placing items inside curly braces { } separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An item has a key and a corresponding value that is expressed as a pair (key: value).\n",
    "\n",
    "- While the values can be of any data type and can repeat, keys must be of immutable type (string, number or tuple with immutable elements) and must be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dictionary Items\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary items are <b>Ordered</b>, <b>Changeable</b>, and <b>Does not allow duplicates.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries were unordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Ordered</b> - When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Changeable</b> - Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Duplicates Not Allowed</b> - Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to use Python Dictionaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you now know what is a Python dictionary, it is time to explore when to use them in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list helping you to understand when to use Python dictionaries;\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the data has a unique reference that can be associated with the value.\n",
    "- When quick access to data items is important. Dictionaries are designed to let us find a value instantly without the need for searching through the whole collection.\n",
    "- When the data order is not important.\n",
    "- As dictionaries are mutable, it is not a good idea to use dictionaries to store data that shouldnâ€™t be modified in the first place.\n",
    "- When memory consideration is not an important factor for the application. Compared to lists and tuples, dictionaries take up more space in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
