15/11/2019, 11:34 am - Poonam Ma'am: Hi Guru - 

I need to communicate the following to the FT students in Pune. Can you please do so on my behalf?

1) The exam papers will be based on the material covered in the class. (A lot of students have asked me if it will be based on material covered in class or the textbook.)

2) The syllabus has been covered almost entirely in the class. One minor topic that I have not been able to cover is Low Budget Product Marketing Ideas. The students need to read various blogs on this topic.

3) I also wanted to show examples of budget templates and sales collateral but I ran out of time. Students need to study these further from various blogs. The basic material has been covered in class.

4) For further market research and analysis case studies, they need to refer to the textbook. The textbook has a few case studies, and also comes with an addendum called "Indian Cases". The students need to read this addendum. 

Thanks, and regards.

Vivek

26/01/2020, 7:21 pm - Guru: https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasudev-murthy-cp-apmp-3113661/  

Hi everyone

I look forward to meeting you all on the *27th of Jan* .

I will introduce myself more formally when we meet, but at this time, I would like to say that I have a lot of industry and teaching experience, which I hope to share with you.

To make this a mutually useful experience, I would like to lay down a few rules.

I am generally a high-energy person and will expect 100% and more from you in the classroom.  Therefore

1. Exercise well before coming to the class. Dress well.
2. Please be at your seat 5 minutes before the start.
3. Using mobile phones for any reason is prohibited. I will consider it a breach of class discipline if I find anyone using it. Please switch off your mobile and keep it away safely.
4. Participate actively and ask me lots of questions.
5. Smile and laugh a lot.
6. Connect with me over LinkedIn before the class.

Best wishes
Vasudev Murthy

 *Please be in the classroom by 9:15 AM.*

Those who have paid, kindly ignore this message. Your immediate action and response would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Dear Poonam:
Kindly block all access after 48 hours for all defaulters. Thank you.

Regards,
Kavitha Srinivasan

12/02/2020, 11:36 am - +91 80955 06555: Hello All:  Greetings!  I am hoping that this will find all of you in great spirits and that you are all doing well in your courses.  Kindly note that your feedback helps us to assess our faculty and provide you with a great customer experience in terms of your learning and industry connect.  Hence, I request you all to ensure that feedback is given before you leave the class and avoid the program managers having to follow up with you later.  It is for your benefit and I hope you understand the same.  It also gives you the opportunity to question us regarding any lapses if you have informed us and given us a feedback, without which there would also be no basis of knowing what you feel.  I hope I will have complete cooperation from all of you about this.  I wish you all a great week ahead and good luck with your course.  Kindly reach out to me on kay.s@ipl.edu.in for any queries or concerns.  Take care.  Best regards, Kavitha Srinivasan

I composed this very simple piece in Raga Shuddha Sarang and distributed it amongst 6 different friends from Roorkee across the world.  3 vocalists in San Francisco, Dubai and Patna.  3 instrumentalists in Bangalore, Lucknow and Noida. Each played their assigned pieces and sent it to someone who stitched the whole thing together seamlessly. Let me know what you think and whether we could do this in this group.

This kind of behavior is not appreciated at all.

17/10/2020, 9:36 am - Neelima: Hi @919686890779 @918884446840 @919606197549

Pls note , we the data science students have classes for ML, deep learning, big data , entrepreneurship as well and we have different projects in each subject. 
Along with that we are having multiple assignments, projects,presentations each week and the time of class is not fixed. 
We arent able to revise the concepts before next class and its getting really difficult to manage everything. 
1) It would be great help if we could get a calendar for the classes so that we have a better clarity in our mind for the classes and can plan accordingly. 
2) We want the notes on haiku to be updated just after the class, the late updation troubles a lot as the some time we have is all gone in asking for the notes and then we arent getting time for revision due to non-availability of the notes on time.
3) We would be able to relate much with the class if we have the pre redings or the knowledge about the topic which would be covered, it would be a great help if you could also look into this aspect.
4) We need breaks as well for self study as we arent able to relate much with the classes due to non revision and working on assignments .

Thanks

I would like to inform you that i have just checked haiku till now not a single subject is uploaded completely with study material for us to study.  We DS students just have a single day for revising the concepts and classes and we dnt want the day to go un-utilized. 
Even after multiple reminders its not done for any of the subject neither deep learning , Nor ML , Nor big data. 
If their is some issue with haiku , 
It would be great if you could mail us the study material directly so that we can study and utilise the day effectively.üôèüèªüôèüèª

We are having our midterm exams according to the University and all the subjects are listed according to the syllabus submitted to the University.
But we have a deep learning Python exam which is not a part of our semester III neither it is in the list of subjects, so where the marks will be counted ?
Its not a part of Semister exam, then what kind of exam it is.. ?
Clarification will be helpful.

Also,we need information on Maximum marks for each mid term exam for data science.

05/01/2021, 8:55 am - IPL Sai Sunder: *A Note on Examination Preparation from Prof. Kishan Malur*

Dear Class, 
First of all wishing you all a very happy new year. May the new year bring all the happiness to you and your family. 

I am writing this to wish you all the very best for your Examination in the next few weeks. I am hoping you are all preparing well for the same. 

For my subject, I wanted to share some general advice to you to prepare better. 

1. Please ensure you go through the class presentations very well for preparation. 
2. In the exam, ensure you write proportionately to the marks allocated to the question. 
3. At the same time, when you write long answers, ensure you give proper paragraph headings to your answers

Wish you all the best again! Hope you do well. 

*Prof. Kishan Malur*

On Monday we have Software Architecture and Solution Architecture paper, as this is a vast subject and we cannot able to cover whole 90 marks in 3 hour 15 minutes.
As you have said that we have a time of 3 hours 30 minutes to complete the exam, but invigilator is allowing only for 3 hours 15 minutes, but to write whole paper for 90 marks we need atleast 3 hours 45 minutes for this paper. 
So i request you to provide more time for examination
Thanks,
