    "The test expression is evaluated and if the result is True, the statement followed by the expression is executed, else if the expression is False, the statement is skipped by the compiler.\n",

    "\n",
    "Otherwise, if the expression is False, Statement block 2 is executed and statement block 1 is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in case after the statement block 1 or 2 gets executed will pass to statement x.\n",

    "Therefore, statement x is executed in every case. \n"
